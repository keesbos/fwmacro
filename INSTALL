There are currently two ways of installing fwmacro, with easy_install or from a
debian package.

fwmacro depends on plex and netaddr.


Installation with easy_install:
make
sudo easy_install dist/fwmacro-*.egg
sudo cp -r etc/fwmacro /etc

Note that the installation with easy_install will not install the manpages.


Installation from debian package:
make
make deb
sudo apt-get python-setuptools
sudo dpkg -i distro/python-fwmacro_*_all.deb
FYI. The debian preinstall script wil do:
    easy_install plex
    easy_install netaddr

The debian package will show up in the distro directory.
